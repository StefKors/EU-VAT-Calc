#What is PL-VAT-Calc? */

Polish tax law is not nice and simple at the first sight. However, with lots of my accountant help I finally
got it.

Schema for calculating VAT for e-services provided by Polish company looks like this:
if buyer is located in:
- Poland - always 23%
- other EU country and is the purchase is not for company purposes - 23 %
- other EU country but purchase is for company purposes - 0% (invoice must be send to customer)
- other country (not EU) - always 0%

## How it works?
It's simple script, so usage is also simple. See example in js file.

## License
It's free / public domain, use it is any way you like. On commercial or non-commercial projects. It would be nice if you
attribute me on a script comment.
